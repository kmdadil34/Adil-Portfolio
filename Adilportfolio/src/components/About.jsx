        One of my notable projects is the Crypto Price Tracker, 
        a React web application that allows users to monitor various cryptocurrencies available in the market.
        By utilizing React components like useState and useEffect, I ensured efficient DOM manipulation, while incorporating Axios for API data retrieval. 
        This project showcases my ability to work with diverse technologies such as ReactJS, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to deliver a dynamic and engaging user interface.
